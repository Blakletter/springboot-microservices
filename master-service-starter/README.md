### Welcome to the UpCancer microservices backend!

All you need to do is have MySql installed and configured correctly, and have the correct database imported. After that, to start the backend, press the green start button.
If you want to start a specific microservice, select the microservice next to the green start button and then press the green start button.
If any service gives you an error, it will show up, and you can create an issue on the github (PLEASE do this so the backend team can resolve the issue as quick as possible)

### Thanks! Enjoy :D
